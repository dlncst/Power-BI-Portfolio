# Power-BI Portfolio
This repository contains a simple data analysis project that includes data transformation, cleaning, and visualization. Along with the README.md file you will find the the sample data used for the project as well as the outcomes.  

## Survey: analyzing multiple variables from survey responders in the Data industry.

This project uses visualizations that include Treemap, Stacked Bar Chart, Stacked Column Chart, Donut Charts, Gauges, and information Cards that provide insights about relationships that affect survey responders that work within the data industry. The dataset 'sample_data.xlsx' combines responses into a structured spreadsheet. 

After a short data cleanup there are different trends that can be identified. For example, we can see that across that across the responders, the average age is 29 years old, and the level of happiness with salary and work/life balance ranks at 4/10 and 5/10 respectevely.
