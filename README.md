# Power-BI Portfolio Summary
This repository contains my Business Intelligence projects in which I worked on data transformation, data connections, analysis and visualization. Along with the README.md file you will find the the sample data used for each project as well as the final report.  

## Project #1 basic: analyzing survey responses from responders working in the data industry.

This project uses visualizations that include Treemap, Stacked Bar Chart, Stacked Column Chart, Donut Charts, Gauges, and information Cards that provide insights about relationships that affect survey responders that work within the data industry. The dataset 'sample_data.xlsx' combines responses into a structured spreadsheet. After a short data cleanup there are different trends that can be seen. For example, we can see that across the responders the average age is 29 years old, and the level of happiness with salary and work/life balance ranks at 4/10 and 5/10 respectively.

Among other trends, this project analyzed and responded to the following points: 
  1. Country Survey Taker
  2. Average Salary by Job Title
  3. Most Used Programming Language
  4. Difficulty Breaking into Industry

## Project #2 intermediate: analyzing students scores and personal interests. 

![project 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d8813c6-838a-4acf-a707-a80d66a754fc)

This project analized the datasets 'StudentTestingData' and 'StudentData'. During this project the data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query. Later on it was analyzed and built into visual elements that include a stacked bar chart, stacked column chart, a matrix as well as a interactive search box to filter the information by category. As the result of these analysis and the data visualization we can conclude that:
- The highest match average scores (all districts) are related to students that had Debate as their extracurricular activities
- Student taking drama as the extracurricular activity were the ones with the lowest math score averages
- The Hawthorn Valley ranked at the top of the districts with the highest average of reading score

## Project #3 advanced: analyzing and reporting on AdventureWorks company datasets for revenue trending, customer behavior, KPI's, etc.
