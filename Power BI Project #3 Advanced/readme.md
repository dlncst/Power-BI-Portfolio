Loading and Transforming Data
For this project I used the AdventureWorks* datasets that include raw data (Product Categories, Returns Data, Customer Lookup, Calendar Lookup, etc.) and sales data (sales data from 2020 to 2022). All these datasets are connected and loaded into this project as text/csv files.
